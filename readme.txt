The persona of Sherlock is someone who is always digging for best deals and he needs someone who can plan a vacation for him or his family within a stipulated budget. He is comfortable with any mode of transport and a true explorer. For him it is about the journey and not the destination, he cares about saving as much as he can on the travel.
Every user can benefit from this app since no other app or web application does this for their users and a multi-city and multi- mode search is almost a dream but we are here to make it real.
